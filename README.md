The project of this site was suggested to me by a good friend who wanted to launch a project. 
Of course, I agreed, because it was a great chance to get acquainted with HTML and JS code.

So, the site has:
1. Buttons for downloading a sample presentation
2. Buttons for scrolling the site to the desired section
3. A button for opening a window over the main page
4. A button for copying the desired text from the field
5. On the mobile version - a sliding menu with buttons, on the web version - the site header
6. A section with beautiful links to social networks
7. Beautiful backgrounds and beautiful elements

The site is adapted to different screen sizes and should open correctly on all devices.

All links are presented in the form of http://example.com

Thank you for visiting my GitHub! Have a nice day!

Best regards, developer jdnjsjsjsjsjs
